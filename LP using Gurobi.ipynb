    "- `\\text{ }` is for displaying the enclosed string as plain text, without the mathematical rendering.\n",
    "- `&` is for alignment. The convention is right align before the first `&`, then left align between the first and second `&` of each line, then right align again between the second and third `&` and so on. Hence, to make it right aligned both before and after the colon, we use a double `&&` after the `\\text{}`. If this is confusing, you can simply copy this convention for this homework (`&&` after the explanation of constraint, and `&` before the sign). \n",

Make sure that you close any braces you begin and put the alignment characters `&` and newlines `\\\\` at the right places, or the math may not render.

    "### Additional instructions and hints\n",
    "When formulating the linear program in part a), **instead of manually defining each variable as in the hint in the book, you should practice using indexing notation**, which also saves you effort on manual input and makes your formulation easily generalizable to larger data sets. You should use the following notation in your formulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $I=\\{A,B,C\\}$ represents the set of plants;\n",
    "- $J=\\{O,T,H,D\\}$ represent the set of manufacturers. \n",
    "- Let your decision variables be $x_{ij}$, which is the amount shipped from plant $i \\in I$ to manufacturer $j \\in J$. (For example $x_{AO}$ is the amount shipped from Arlington to Onyx. $\\sum_{j\\in J} x_{Aj}$ is the total amount produced from Arlington. $\\sum_{i \\in I} x_{iO}$ is the total amount shipped to Onyx.)\n",
    "- For each plant $i \\in I$, the production cost is $p_i$ and the monthly capacity is $q_i$. (For example, $p_A=17$ and $q_A=800$.)\n",
    "- For each manufactuer $j \\in J$, the demand of motors per month is given by $d_j$. (For example, $d_O=300$, $d_T=500$.) \n",
    "- For each plant $i\\in I$ and each manufacturer $j\\in J$, the transportation cost from plant $i$ to manufactuer $j$ can be indexed by $c_{ij}$. (For example using the data from the table associated with the question, $c_{AO}=3$, $c_{BT}=4$.)\n",
    "\n",
    "To write a indexed variable in Latex, you can use `c_{ij}` for $c_{ij}$ (make sure to enclose it either in single dollar sign for in-line math or double-dollar sign for stand-alone math). To write summation, you can use the command `\\sum`, with underline and braces to indicate the set you are summing over. For example (double click the following expression to see the code), \n",
    "$$\\text{Total transportation cost} = \\sum_{i \\in I, j \\in J} c_{ij}x_{ij}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The above expression is equivalent to looping over both the set of plants $I$ and set of manufacturers $J$ and adding the term $c_{ij} x_{ij}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The summation notation helps you express many constraints at once. For example you can write the capacity constraint at all three plants using the equation\n",
    "$$ \\text{Respecting capacity:  } \\sum_{j \\in J} x_{ij} \\le q_i \\text{ for every plant $i \\in I$}.$$\n",
